<p class = "text-left"> The first type of meditation is mindfulness of breath. The most basic way to do mindful breathing is simply to focus your attention on your breath, the inhale and exhale. You can do this while standing, but ideally you’ll be sitting or even lying in a comfortable position. Your eyes may be open or closed, but you may find it easier to maintain your focus if you close your eyes. It can help to set aside a designated time for this exercise, but it can also help to practice it when you’re feeling particularly stressed or anxious. Experts believe a regular practice of mindful breathing can make it easier to do it in difficult situations. 

Sometimes, especially when trying to calm yourself in a stressful moment, it might help to start by taking an exaggerated breath: a deep inhale through your nostrils (3 seconds), hold your breath (2 seconds), and a long exhale through your mouth (4 seconds). Otherwise, simply observe each breath without trying to adjust it; it may help to focus on the rise and fall of your chest or the sensation through your nostrils. As you do so, you may find that your mind wanders, distracted by thoughts or bodily sensations. That’s OK. Just notice that this is happening and gently bring your attention back to your breath. Continue doing this for 15 to 30 minutes twice a day to feel the full effects of this meditation.</p></div>

   <div>
<p class = "text-left"> The second type of meditation is Loving Kindness Meditation. To do loving kindness meditation, you first have to calm your mind and anchor it to your breath. Once your mind is settled and you can focus, begin by imagining a baby. Keep picturing the baby until you have a feeling of love in your heart. Afterwards, move on to picturing your friends and family. They are all laughing and joyful, free from suffering. Keep picturing this as your feeling of love gets stronger. Next picture what you fear. It does not need to be humans. Once you have generated love for what you fear, you are ready to generate love for who you hate. Imagine the person you hate being mean to you. Use all the love that you have generated within you, and learn to accept them for who they are. Finally, you are ready for the final step. You now have enough love to accept yourself. Imagine yourself as you are right now. Feel the love inside of you go through your body all over like a positive luminous force that is soothing  every cell in your body. Try to do this powerful meditation twice a day for 30 minutes to receive the full benefits. </p></div>
